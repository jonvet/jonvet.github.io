## About

Welcome!

This is a place where I'll occasionally write about my learnings in the area of quantum computing (QC). 
My QC journey started in 2021 and continued in an on and off fashion since then.
Any posts will be written in a way that I hope will help people get started with QC who are in a similar position as I was in 2021.
In other words, I'm writing about things that I wish I had known, or explained in a certain way, back then.
My background is in machine learning and economics, so I don't claim to get it right all the time or be exhaustive and rigorous in my explanations.
I'm just trying to make it easier for people to get started with QC.
It's also a selfish project in the sense that I believe that the best way to learn something is to teach it. Or to write it down somewhere.

When it comes to learning something new, it often helps me to hear about the same topic from different sources.
Everyone has a different way of explaining things, and even if it's a bit repetitive, sometimes one just has to spend time to get used to new concepts.
Here are some of the materials and sources that I've used and found helpful, in no particular order:
- [IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com) (formerly Qiskit textbook)
- Participating in IBM [Quantum Summer Schools](https://qiskit.org/events/summer-school-2023) and [Quantum Challenges](https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-challenge-spring-2023) (they run once a year)
- Bob Coecke's books [Quantum in Pictures](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quantum-Pictures-New-Understand-World/dp/1739214714/ref=pd_sbs_d_sccl_3_1/259-5435121-5002665?pd_rd_w=DfLu0&content-id=amzn1.sym.f5d177b3-9290-4c61-8b0e-06b08cdd933f&pf_rd_p=f5d177b3-9290-4c61-8b0e-06b08cdd933f&pf_rd_r=VK1ZR0X3083DWTPMQ7ZS&pd_rd_wg=gLuJf&pd_rd_r=b61c28c3-3634-4e42-ad04-80f321d18b0c&pd_rd_i=1739214714&psc=1) and [Picturing Quantum Processes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Picturing-Quantum-Processes-Diagrammatic-Reasoning/dp/110710422X/ref=asc_df_110710422X/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310810203983&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8808679441811537029&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006886&hvtargid=pla-417328340871&psc=1&mcid=132472b9806a3ad3bfead5caa287876f&th=1&psc=1)
